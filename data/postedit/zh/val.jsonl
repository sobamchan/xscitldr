{"source": "Each training step for a variational autoencoder (VAE) requires us to sample from the approximate posterior, so we usually choose simple (e.g. factorised) approximate posteriors in which sampling is an efficient computation that fully exploits GPU parallelism.  However, such simple approximate posteriors are often insufficient, as they eliminate statistical dependencies in the posterior.  While it is possible to use normalizing flow approximate posteriors for continuous latents, there is nothing analogous for discrete latents.The most natural approach to model discrete dependencies is an autoregressive distribution, but sampling from such distributions is inherently sequential and thus slow.  We develop a fast, parallel sampling procedure for autoregressive distributions based on fixed-point iterations which enables efficient and accurate variational inference in discrete state-space models.  To optimize the variational bound, we considered two ways to evaluate probabilities: inserting the relaxed samples directly into the pmf for the discrete distribution, or converting to continuous logistic latent variables and interpreting the K-step fixed-point iterations as a normalizing flow.  We found that converting to continuous latent variables gave considerable additional scope for mismatch between the true and approximate posteriors, which resulted in biased inferences, we thus used the former approach.

{"source": "Conventional deep reinforcement learning typically determines an appropriate primitive action at each timestep, which requires enormous amount of time and effort for learning an effective policy, especially in large and complex environments.To deal with the issue fundamentally, we incorporate macro actions, defined as sequences of primitive actions, into the primitive action space to form an augmented action space.The problem lies in how to find an appropriate macro action to augment the primitive action space.  The agent using a proper augmented action space is able to jump to a farther state and thus speed up the exploration process as well as facilitate the learning procedure.In previous researches, macro actions are developed by mining the most frequently used action sequences or repeating previous actions.However, the most frequently used action sequences are extracted from a past policy, which may only reinforce the original behavior of that policy.On the other hand, repeating actions may limit the diversity of behaviors of the agent.Instead, we propose to construct macro actions by a genetic algorithm, which eliminates the dependency of the macro action derivation procedure from the past policies of the agent.  Our approach appends a macro action to the primitive action space once at a time and evaluates whether the augmented action space leads to promising performance or not.   We perform extensive experiments and show that the constructed macro actions are able to speed up the learning process for a variety of deep reinforcement learning methods.Our experimental results also demonstrate that the macro actions suggested by our approach are transferable among deep reinforcement learning methods and similar environments.We further provide a comprehensive set of ablation analysis to validate our methodology.", "target": ["我们建议通过遗传算法来构建宏观行动，这就消除了宏观行动推导过程对代理过去策略的依赖性。", "本文提出了一种通用算法，通过在原始动作空间中附加一个宏观动作来构建深度强化学习的宏观动作。"]}

Moreover,  the  gradient  updates  suffer  from  several sources of noise leading to a degraded performance.   In this work,  we propose a meta-learning algorithm equipped with the GradiEnt Component COrrections, aGECCO cell for short, which generates a multiplicative corrective low-rank matrix which (after vectorization) corrects the estimated gradients. GECCO contains a simple decoder-like network with learnable parameters, an attention module and a so-called context input parameter. The context parameter of GECCO is updated to  generate  a  low-rank  corrective  term  for  the  network  gradients.   As  a  result, meta-learning requires only a few of gradient updates to absorb new task (often, a single update is sufficient in the few-shot scenario). While previous approaches address this problem by altering the learning rates, factorising network parameters or directly learning feature corrections from features and/or gradients, GECCO is an off-the-shelf generator-like unit that performs element-wise gradient corrections without the need to â€˜observeâ€™ the features and/or the gradients directly.

Moreover, we introduce higher-order permutation points by exploiting the hierarchical structure in the loss landscapes of neural networks, and find that the number of $K$-th order permutation points is much larger than the (already huge) number of equivalent global minima -- at least by a polynomial factor of order $K$.

{"source": "Network pruning has emerged as a powerful technique for reducing the size of deep neural networks.Pruning uncovers high-performance subnetworks by taking a trained dense network and gradually removing unimportant connections.Recently, alternative techniques have emerged for training sparse networks directly without having to train a large dense model beforehand, thereby achieving small memory footprints during both training and inference.These techniques are based on dynamic reallocation of non-zero parameters during training.Thus, they are in effect executing a training-time search for the optimal subnetwork.We investigate a most recent one of these techniques and conduct additional experiments to elucidate its behavior in training sparse deep convolutional networks.Dynamic parameter reallocation converges early during training to a highly trainable subnetwork.We show that neither the structure, nor the initialization of the discovered high-performance subnetwork is sufficient to explain its good performance.Rather, it is the dynamics of parameter reallocation that are responsible for successful learning.Dynamic parameter reallocation thus improves the trainability of deep convolutional networks, playing a similar role as overparameterization, without incurring the memory and computational cost of the latter.", "target": ["动态参数重新分配能够成功地直接训练紧凑的稀疏网络，即使在我们预先知道最佳稀疏网络的情况下，它也发挥着不可或缺的作用。"]}
