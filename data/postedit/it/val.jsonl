{"source": "Each training step for a variational autoencoder (VAE) requires us to sample from the approximate posterior, so we usually choose simple (e.g. factorised) approximate posteriors in which sampling is an efficient computation that fully exploits GPU parallelism.  However, such simple approximate posteriors are often insufficient, as they eliminate statistical dependencies in the posterior.  While it is possible to use normalizing flow approximate posteriors for continuous latents, there is nothing analogous for discrete latents.The most natural approach to model discrete dependencies is an autoregressive distribution, but sampling from such distributions is inherently sequential and thus slow.  We develop a fast, parallel sampling procedure for autoregressive distributions based on fixed-point iterations which enables efficient and accurate variational inference in discrete state-space models.  To optimize the variational bound, we considered two ways to evaluate probabilities: inserting the relaxed samples directly into the pmf for the discrete distribution, or converting to continuous logistic latent variables and interpreting the K-step fixed-point iterations as a normalizing flow.  We found that converting to continuous latent variables gave considerable additional scope for mismatch between the true and approximate posteriors, which resulted in biased inferences, we thus used the former approach.

{"source": "Training conditional generative latent-variable models is challenging in scenarios where the conditioning signal is very strong and the decoder is expressive enough to generate a plausible output given only the condition; the generative model tends to ignore the latent variable, suffering from posterior collapse. We find, and empirically show, that one of the major reasons behind posterior collapse is rooted in the way that generative models are conditioned, i.e., through concatenation of the latent variable and the condition. To mitigate this problem, we propose to explicitly make the latent variables depend on the condition by unifying the conditioning and latent variable sampling, thus coupling them so as to prevent the model from discarding the root of variations. To achieve this, we develop a conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture that learns a distribution not only of the latent variables, but also of the condition, the latter acting as prior on the former.

The agent using a proper augmented action space is able to jump to a farther state and thus speed up the exploration process as well as facilitate the learning procedure.In previous researches, macro actions are developed by mining the most frequently used action sequences or repeating previous actions.However, the most frequently used action sequences are extracted from a past policy, which may only reinforce the original behavior of that policy.On the other hand, repeating actions may limit the diversity of behaviors of the agent.Instead, we propose to construct macro actions by a genetic algorithm, which eliminates the dependency of the macro action derivation procedure from the past policies of the agent.  Our approach appends a macro action to the primitive action space once at a time and evaluates whether the augmented action space leads to promising performance or not.

We find that our explanations provide additional information not typically captured by saliency maps alone, and can also improve performance on the classic task of attribute recognition.Our approach's ability to generalize is demonstrated on two datasets from diverse domains, Polyvore Outfits and Animals with Attributes 2.", "target": ["Un approccio a scatola nera per spiegare le previsioni di un modello di image similarity.", "Introduce un metodo per la spiegazione del modello di image similarity che identifica gli attributi che contribuiscono positivamente al punteggio di somiglianza e li accoppia con una mappa generata di saliency.", "L'articolo propone un meccanismo di explanation che accoppia le regioni tipiche della mappa di saliency insieme agli attributi per le deep neural network per similarity matching."]}

Following the notation of Gong et al.

We do assume, however, that we can sometimes observe a so-called identifier or ID variable.We might know, for example, that two images show the same person, with ID referring to the identity of the person.In data augmentation, we generate several images from the same original image, with ID referring to the relevant original image.The method requires only a small fraction of images to have an ID variable.We provide a causal framework for the problem by adding the ID variable to the model of Gong et al. (2016).However, we are interested in settings where we cannot observe the domain directly and we treat domain as a latent variable.If two or more samples share the same class and identifier, (Y, ID)=(y,i), then we treat those samples as counterfactuals under different style interventions on the orthogonal or style features.Using this grouping-by-ID approach, we regularize the network to provide near constant output across samples that share the same ID by penalizing with an appropriate graph Laplacian.This is shown to substantially improve performance in settings where domains change in terms of image quality, brightness, color changes, and more complex changes such as changes in movement and posture.We show links to questions of interpretability, fairness and transfer learning.", "target": ["Proponiamo una regolarizzazione controfattuale per difendersi dagli adversarial domain shift che si verificano attraverso spostamenti nella distribuzione delle \"style feature\" latenti delle immagini.", "L'articolo discute i modi per difendersi dagli adversarial domain shift con la regolarizzazione controfattuale imparando un classificatore che è invariante ai cambiamenti superficiali (o feature di \"stile\") nelle immagini.", "Questo documento mira a una classificazione robusta delle immagini contro gli adversarial domain shift e l'obiettivo è raggiunto evitando di usare le feature di stile mutevoli."]}

{"source": "Policy gradients methods often achieve better performance when the change in policy is limited to a small Kullback-Leibler divergence.We derive policy gradients where the change in policy is limited to a small Wasserstein distance (or trust region).This is done in the discrete and continuous multi-armed bandit settings with entropy regularisation.We show that in the small steps limit with respect to the Wasserstein distance $W_2$, policy dynamics are governed by the heat equation, following the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto result.This means that policies undergo diffusion and advection, concentrating near actions with high reward.This helps elucidate the nature of convergence in the probability matching setup, and provides justification for empirical practices such as Gaussian policy priors and additive gradient noise.", "target": ["Si collegano i gradienti di policy entropica della regione di Wasserstein-trust e l'equazione del calore.", "L'articolo esplora le connessioni tra reinforcement learning e la teoria del trasporto ottimale quadratico", "Gli autori hanno studiato il gradiente della policy con il cambiamento delle policy limitato da una regione di fiducia della distanza di Wasserstein nel setting del multi-armed bandit, mostrando che nel limite degli small step, la dinamica della policy è governata dall'equazione del calore (equazione di Fokker-Planck)."]}
{"source": "The softmax function is widely used to train deep neural networks for multi-class classification.Despite its outstanding performance in classification tasks, the features derived from the supervision of softmax are usually sub-optimal in some scenarios where Euclidean distances apply in feature spaces.To address this issue, we propose a new loss, dubbed the isotropic loss, in the sense that the overall distribution of data points is regularized to approach the isotropic normal one.Combined with the vanilla softmax, we formalize a novel criterion called the isotropic softmax, or isomax for short, for supervised learning of deep neural networks.By virtue of the isomax, the intra-class features are penalized by the isotropic loss while inter-class distances are well kept by the original softmax loss.Moreover, the isomax loss does not require any additional modifications to the network, mini-batches or the training process.Extensive experiments on classification and clustering are performed to demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the isomax loss.", "target": ["La capacità discriminativa di softmax per l'apprendimento di vettori di feature di oggetti è efficacemente migliorata dalla normalizzazione isotropica sulla distribuzione globale dei punti dati."]}
{"source": "A fundamental question in reinforcement learning is whether model-free algorithms are sample efficient.Recently,  Jin et al. (2018) proposed a Q-learning algorithm with UCB exploration policy, and proved it has nearly optimal regret bound for finite-horizon episodic MDP.In this paper, we adapt Q-learning with UCB-exploration bonus to infinite-horizon MDP with discounted rewards \\emph{without} accessing a generative model.We show that the \\textit{sample complexity of exploration} of our algorithm is bounded by $\\tilde{O}({\\frac{SA}{\\epsilon^2(1-\\gamma)^7}})$.This improves the previously best known result of $\\tilde{O}({\\frac{SA}{\\epsilon^4(1-\\gamma)^8}})$ in this setting achieved by delayed Q-learning (Strehlet al., 2006),, and matches the lower bound in terms of $\\epsilon$ as well as $S$ and $A$ up to logarithmic factors.", "target": ["Adattiamo Q-learning con bonus UCB-exploration a MDP infinite-horizon con reward scontate senza accedere a un modello generativo, e migliora il miglior risultato precedentemente conosciuto.", "Questo articolo ha considerato un algoritmo di Q learning con una policy di esplorazione UCB per MDP infinite-horizon."]}
{"source": "Backpropagation is driving today's artificial neural networks (ANNs).However, despite extensive research, it remains unclear if the brain implements this algorithm.Among neuroscientists, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are often seen as a realistic alternative: neurons can randomly introduce change, and use unspecific feedback signals to observe their effect on the cost and thus approximate their gradient.However, the convergence rate of such learning scales poorly with the number of involved neurons.Here we propose a hybrid learning approach.Each neuron uses an RL-type strategy to learn how to approximate the gradients that backpropagation would provide.We provide proof that our approach converges to the true gradient for certain classes of networks.In both feedforward and convolutional networks, we empirically show that our approach learns to approximate the gradient, and can match the performance of gradient-based learning.Learning feedback weights provides a biologically plausible mechanism of achieving good performance, without the need for precise, pre-specified learning rules.", "target": ["Le perturbazioni possono essere usate per addestrare i pesi di feedback per imparare in reti neurali fully connected e convoluzionali", "Questo articolo propone un metodo che affronta il problema del \"trasporto dei pesi\" stimando i pesi per il backward pass usando uno stimatore basato sul rumore "]}
